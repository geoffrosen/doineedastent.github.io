This website was inspired by [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/02/when-evidence-says-no-but-doctors-say-yes/517368/).

It suggested that many patients may suffer harm from more stents being placed than necessary. Further, it suggested that patients with agency were better able to negotiate this with their physiciants. The purpose of this site is to help patients to have the knowledge and confidence to have a discussion with their doctors.
